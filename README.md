# Data types

# Data types are used to store different type of values like characters, Numbers, symbol, etc.

# in JavaScript there are two types of Data Types

( 1 ) Primitive Data type
 
( 2 ) Non Primitive Data type

. Primitive Data types : in JavaScript Primitive Data types are immutable means we can not change or remove some character from a Non-Primitive Data types. these are 
also known as pass by value means when we declare a variable of non-primitive data type then the variable will have the access of only value not the memory location of
the varible that is assigned to that variable.

Ex: let a = "variable"

console.log(a)  // variable

a[2] = 'o'

console.log(a)  // variable
